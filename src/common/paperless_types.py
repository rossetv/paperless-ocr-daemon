"""TypedDict wire shapes for the Paperless-ngx REST API.

The JSON the Paperless-ngx API returns and accepts, pinned as ``TypedDict``s
(CODE_GUIDELINES §5.3) so daemon code names fields and types instead of
indexing a bare ``dict``.  These describe the *foreign* wire shape; a daemon
translates them into domain dataclasses at its boundary.  :mod:`common.paperless`
re-exports every name here, so callers import from ``common.paperless`` and need
not know the shapes live in a sibling module — the split exists only to keep
``paperless.py`` under the file-size ceiling (CODE_GUIDELINES §3.1).

    """Keyword arguments accepted by :meth:`PaperlessClient.update_document_metadata`.

    ``total=False`` means every key is optional. The caller's intent is inferred
    from presence vs absence:

    - **Absent key** — field was not supplied; Paperless is not touched for it.
    - **Present key with ``None`` value** — field was explicitly cleared; Paperless
      receives ``null`` and clears the field on the document.

    ``tags`` is always a concrete set — ``None`` is not a valid value and will
    not be forwarded (callers use an empty set to clear all tags).

    ``notes`` is a special case: Paperless stores notes at a separate endpoint
    (``/api/documents/{id}/notes/``) rather than the document PATCH endpoint.
    When provided, all existing notes are deleted and the new text is posted
    (or the document is left with no notes if the value is the empty string).

    PATCH field — the physical archive serial number for the document.
